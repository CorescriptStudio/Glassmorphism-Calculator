# 🧮 Glassmorphism Calculator

A Stunning, Modern Calculator with Frosted Glass Aesthetics

Welcome to the Glassmorphism Calculator repository! This project represents a cutting-edge exploration of modern UI trends, specifically focusing on the "Glassmorphism" design language. It combines a semi-transparent, frosted-glass interface with vivid neon accents, a fully responsive layout, and a custom interactive cursor to deliver a premium user experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application is not just a functional tool but a demonstration of advanced CSS styling and pure JavaScript logic. The interface floats above an animated background, using backdrop filters to create a sense of depth and materiality. It is built entirely without external frameworks, ensuring lightweight performance and cross-browser compatibility.

## ✨ Key Features

⭐ Glassmorphism UI
Utilizes backdrop-filter: blur() and semi-transparent RGBA layers to achieve a realistic frosted glass effect that adapts to the background elements behind it.

⭐ Dual Theme System
Seamlessly toggle between two distinct visual modes:

Deep Neon (Dark Mode) A rich navy background with electric blue and purple accents, perfect for low-light environments.

Frosty White (Light Mode) A clean, silver-white aesthetic with soft shadows and crisp typography.

⭐ Custom Interactive Cursor
Features a unique "Dot" cursor that replaces the default system pointer. The cursor trails the mouse movement smoothly and changes color dynamically based on the active theme (Neon Cyan in Dark Mode, Royal Blue in Light Mode).

⭐ Robust Calculation Logic
Powered by a custom JavaScript class that handles:

Basic Arithmetic (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)

Modulo Operations

Floating Point Precision handling

Formatted number displays with commas

⭐ Fully Responsive
The layout adjusts gracefully from desktop monitors down to mobile screens, ensuring buttons remain touch-friendly and the display remains legible on all devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5
Provides the semantic structure for the calculator grid and display areas.

CSS3
Handles the heavy lifting for the visual design, including:

CSS Variables for instant theming

Flexbox and Grid for layout

Keyframe animations for background orbs

Transitions for hover states and button presses

JavaScript (ES6+)
Manages the application state, calculation logic, DOM manipulation for the cursor, and event listeners for both mouse clicks and keyboard input.

## 📲 Installation and Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project folder.

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

No build steps or package managers are required!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design focuses on Depth, Hierarchy, and Clarity. By using soft shadows and blur effects, the calculator appears to float above the abstract background orbs. The user interface prioritizes the most important elements (the display and equals button) through color contrast and size, while the custom cursor adds a layer of playful interactivity often missing from utility web apps.
